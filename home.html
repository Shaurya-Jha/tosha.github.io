        </div><br>

        <p>Animation is when images of figures are manipulated to appear to the human eye as though they are moving. In traditional animation,
            images are drawn individually to be photographed or put onto film. Another kind of traditional animation is called stop motion animation.
            With this, three dimensional figures are painstakingly committed to film, frame by frame, being moved slightly between shots. With 3D animation,
            all of the images are created using computer graphics.There are numerous benefits for 3D animation for a wide variety of companies across many industries.It catches the audience’s attention: With its broad appeal, 3D animation captures people’s attention from the moment it’s on.It engages the audience: 3D animation is the ideal way to promote audience participation, increasing interest in a brand.It attracts a larger audience: Because it can be posted on multiple outlets and platforms, company’s can reach a much wider audience.
            It builds a brand: 3D animation is one of the most effective tools for successful branding, in part for all of the aforementioned reasons, but also because on its own it helps establish a strong reputation and enhances the message.It communicates a lot quickly: The brain can process visual images up to 60,000 times faster than text. This means you can say so much more in a much shorter amount of time.And that bring us to the number one benefit of using 3D animation: it lets you tell your company’s story most effectively.</p>

            </div><br>

            <p>2D animation is the art of creating movement in a two-dimensional space. This includes characters, creatures, FX and backgrounds.2D animators convey stories or messages by making their characters, objects and backgrounds move in a two-dimensional environment.The illusion of movement is created when individual drawings are sequenced together over time. One second of time is usually divided into 24 frames. Depending on the style of animation there can be as many as 24 unique drawings in one second of animation (24fps) or as little as two. Conventionally animation is done on "2s" meaning there is a drawing every 2 frames (12fps). This allows artists to save on production time/costs and gives 2D animation its unique look.It is easy to handle without any tutorials.The production lead time for 2D animation is low and it is quicker to produce.It is cheaper when compared to 3D animation. 2D involves less technology and software and hence it is easier to produce when compared to 3D.</p>

                <h2><span>Video Editing</span></h2>
            </div><br>

            <p>The medium of film and video is fundamentally linear. Certainly there are stories that are told in non-linear ways, but every video starts at a point in time and moves forward, very much like a train heading toward it’s destination. It’s no wonder that the term “tracks” describes the metaphorical space within which video and audio are arranged in a video editing program.In order to fully understand video editing, the idea of choosing distinct points in time is extremely important. You may have heard of three-point editing, which is a technique of editing, but also reflects how video editing works. Put another way, the process of video editing is essentially taking something long and making it shorter. But In order to make that happen, the editor must identify the point in time to start a selection. Let’s say it’s right at the beginning (POINT 1). The next thing she needs to do is determine the end of the selection, let’s say twenty minutes later (POINT 2). Where’s the third point? Recall the train track. Right now that track is empty and is waiting to be loaded with cargo. The point at which you place your selection (your cargo) is the third point in three-point editing.</p>
